Tools for compressing / decompressing block-compression files.

Block compression is another name for the encoding compressed DDS files use (where it is called DXT - DirectX Texture Compression) and S3TC (S3 Texture Compression).

The aim of this library is to support all of the currently released BC specifications (BC 1 through 7).

The crate is named "block-compression" because this name is more general and doesn't lean towards Direct3D nor OpenGL / Vulkan.
