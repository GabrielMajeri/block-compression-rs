## Writing code
Whether you are a begginer rustacean or an expert, there are many ways to help through coding.

### New features
If you want to add support for some new block-compression algorithm, or for some file format that uses BC to store image data,
feel free to work on the feature and then submit a pull request.

### Refactoring / improving performance
When this library was started, convenience and safety was the priority. However, Rust allows us to offer performance while maintaing
code cleanness. Please sumbit pull request that make the code clearer or faster, and add appropiate benchmarks.

### Tests
The unit / integration tests of this library are not exhaustive. As bugs are reported and features are added, additional regression
and integration tests might be required.

## Writing documentation
Better, more readable documentation is something to strive for. Peruse the docs and submit a pull request if you believe you can
